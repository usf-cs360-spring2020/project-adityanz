Link to my [final portfolio](https://usf-cs360-spring2020.github.io/project-adityanz/)

This is my final project for my Data visualization class in which I implemented a stacked bar, a map and a circle packing with cross filtering and interactivity.

This is a template website using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [FontAwesome](https://origin.fontawesome.com/) for icons, and [Github Pages](). Designed to be modified (including this README file).

*Template based on: <https://github.com/usf-cs360-spring2020/template-bulma>*
