        <h4>Project Narrative</h4>
        <p> San Francsico is known to be one of the most food eccentric cities in the world, and is home to top leading restaurnts and people come from all over the world to try the special dishes the cullinary artists create. However, it is important to note the health and saftey of people, and a lot of these resturants in the city, have been known to have poor sanitation and hygeine standards. I wanted to map out all the food places and see if any sort of external or internal factors may have some cause with this. I also wanted to look at the populairty and the raitings and see if that improves/ makes the sanitation worse. I want to find a relationship between the yelp data and the health data and try to draw conclusions and connections to see what the relationship is, if any exists.
