                      <h2>Instructor Feedback Sessions</h2>
                      <p> I ended up getting a lot of useful feedbaack from the instructor, in regards to trying to make my stacked bar and my map more linked and interactive. The Professor
                        ended up telling me to try and play around with the categorical and the measurements and try and see if I could create links. I ended up not stepping the colors and making them more discrete. I also ended up
                        using the price categories on my stacked bar and making it more interactive. I also added the % of the total bar that it represented.
