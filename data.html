        <h3 id="wrangling">Wrangling and Filtering</h3>
        <p> I originally downloaded the whole dataset since I wanted to work with more categories. </p>
        <p> It was important to see the relevance and the importance of the data. </p>
        <p> Filter the dataset to show cases that were OPENED in the month of February 2020 only. Then choose a CATEGORY that has at least 100 cases associated with it. For example, this includes "Street and Sidewalk Cleaning" (approximately 21k cases) and "Residential Building Request" (approximately 100 cases).</p>
        <p> I ended up not doing that much data wrangling for this project. </p>
