          <p>The second data set was taken from Kaggle and shows the <a href="http://kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset"> Yelp Dataset </a> and it will focus on the city and county of San Francisco, even though the Data has information from all of the USA.
          <p>It collects data of the latest health score of the restaurant</p>
          <p> I also want to use the yelp dataset in order to get the average review score from yelp and see if that had an effect on the health score and the way the people percieved the resturants </p>

        <h3 id="wrangling">Wrangling and Filtering</h3>
        <p> I originally downloaded the whole dataset since I wanted to work with more categories. </p>
        <p> Since I am still working with the data, I have currently not done any wrangling and filtering yet. </p>
        <!-- <p> It was important to see the relevance and the importance of the data. </p>
        <p> Filter the dataset to show cases that were OPENED in the month of February 2020 only. Then choose a CATEGORY that has at least 100 cases associated with it. For example, this includes "Street and Sidewalk Cleaning" (approximately 21k cases) and "Residential Building Request" (approximately 100 cases).</p>
        <p> I ended up not doing that much data wrangling for this project. </p> -->
